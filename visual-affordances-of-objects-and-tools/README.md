# visual-affordances-of-objects-and-tools

The dataset contains results of trials in which the robot executes different actions with multiple tools on various objects. In total, there are 11 objects, 4 actions, 3 tools and at least 10 repetitions of each trial, which sums up to ~1320 unique trials and 5280 unique images of resolution 320×200 pixels. The images are captured from left and right cameras of the robot before and after executing a successful action. Moreover, the 3D position of the object together with some extracted features are also available. For more information contact adehban at isr dot tecnico dot ulisboa dot pt.
